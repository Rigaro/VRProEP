# Virtual Reality Prosthesis Evaluation Platform
Platform for evaluating and customizing prosthetic devices using virtual reality.
Development is generalized from the online synergy identification platform.

Wiki: https://github.com/Rigaro/VRProEP/wiki

## Features
- User data: User/subject information and experimental data is stored externally to software data to protect personal information. Experimental data is stored anonymously.
- Prosthetic devices: Allows the addition of commercial (3D models) or custom virtual prosthetic devices and to automatically personalise their dimensions to the users/subjects.
- Human-prosthetic interfaces: Allows the implementation of different interfaces. Currently implemented: sEMG proportional, Motion-based.
- Object interaction: Allows interaction with objects through a VR controller (able-bodied) or through the virtual prosthetic devices and interfaces.
- Mixed reality: Allows recording of the user and virtual reality environment in Mixed Reality by placing the user in the virtual world.
- External hardware: Allows the integration of external hardware devices. Currently implemented: bone conduction feedback device, myoware sEMG electrode system.
